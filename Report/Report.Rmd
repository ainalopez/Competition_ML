# Introduction

1. Create new variables
2. Feature Selection
3. Create the model
4. Evaluate the model 
5. Upload in Kaggle


# Additional variables

The url of the articles include useful information that can potentially imporve our prerformance in the competition. An example of the url is the following:

**http://mashable.com/2014/01/12/game-of-thrones-season-4-trailer**

From the url we can get the year, day and month then it was published as well as some keywords of the content of the article. 

Using text mining techniques we can get all the keywords of the article titles. With this we can create new variables indicating whether a specific word appears in the title of the article. Given that we have many keywords, we create variables only for those keywords that have appeared in at least 150 observations.


# Evaluation 

In order to evaluate our models, we decided to use 5-fold Cross Validation


explain 5-fold CV


# Variable Selection: RFF




# Models 

* Random Forest

* K-nearest neighbors

* SVM

* Boosting


# Results
